##  **Interactive Tableau Dashboard — Visual Analysis Project**

###  **Overview**

This project uses Tableau to visualize and analyze price trends and patterns across multiple measures.
The data was reshaped and used to build **four interactive visualizations**:

1. Multi-line Time Series
2. Histogram Distribution
3. Scatter Plot (Dynamic Measure Comparison)
4. Boxplot (Monthly Distribution & Outliers)

---

##  **Data Preparation**

**Steps followed:**

1. Connected the Excel dataset to Tableau.
2. On the **Data Source** page, selected all price-related columns (columns 2–19).
3. Right-click → **Pivot**.
4. Renamed generated fields:

   * `Pivot Field Names` → **Measure**
   * `Pivot Field Values` → **Value**
5. Ensured `Date` is recognized as **Date type**.

 **Why this helps:**
This “long” format allows all measures to be analyzed flexibly with parameters and filters.

##  **Visualization 1 — Multi-line Time Series**

**Goal:** Show time-based trends and allow users to select which measures to view.

**Steps:**

1. Create a **new worksheet** → rename to **Time Series – Multi Measure**.
2. Drag **Date → Columns**, right-click → choose desired granularity (e.g., *Month*).
3. Drag **Value → Rows**.
4. Drag **Measure → Color** and also **Measure → Filters**.
5. On the Filter card → select **Multiple Values (dropdown)** for user multi-selection.
6. Change **Marks type → Line**.

 **Result:**
A clean time series chart showing the trend of one or more selected measures over time.

##  **Visualization 2 — Histogram (Distribution of Selected Measure)**

**Goal:** Show the distribution of price values for the chosen measure.

**Steps:**

1. Created a **calculated field**:

   * Name: `Number of Records`
   * Formula: `1`
2. New sheet → rename to **Histogram – Distribution**.
3. Drag **Value → Columns**.

   * Right-click `Value` → **Create → Bins…** → choose bin size (e.g., 5, 10, or Automatic).
   * Replace original Value with `Value (bin)` on Columns.
4. Drag **Number of Records → Rows**.
5. Drag **Measure → Filters** → **Show Filter** → choose **Single/Multiple Values dropdown**.
6. Remove `SUM(Value)` if Tableau adds it automatically to Columns.

 **Result:**
A histogram that displays how the values of a selected measure are distributed across ranges.

##  **Visualization 3 — Scatter Plot (Compare Two Measures)**

**Goal:** Allow users to select any two measures (X and Y) to visualize their relationship.

**Steps:**

### Step 1 — Create Parameters

1. Right-click in **Data Pane → Create Parameter** → Name it **X Measure**.

   * Data type: *String*
   * Allowable values: *List* → *Add from Field → Measure* → OK.
2. Repeat the same for **Y Measure**.
3. Right-click both → **Show Parameter Control** (they appear as dropdowns).

### Step 2 — Create Calculated Fields

* **X Value**

  ```
  IF [Measure] = [X Measure] THEN [Value] END
  ```
* **Y Value**

  ```
  IF [Measure] = [Y Measure] THEN [Value] END
  ```

### Step 3 — Aggregate by Date

Create two more calculated fields to ensure one value per date:

* **X per Date**

  ```
  { FIXED [Date] : MAX(IF [Measure] = [X Measure] THEN [Value] END) }
  ```
* **Y per Date**

  ```
  { FIXED [Date] : MAX(IF [Measure] = [Y Measure] THEN [Value] END) }
  ```

### Step 4 — Build Scatter Plot

1. New sheet → rename to **Scatter – X vs Y**.
2. Drag **X per Date → Columns**, **Y per Date → Rows**.
3. Drag **Date → Detail** (each point = one date).
4. Set **Marks type → Circle**.
5. Optional: Drag **Measure → Color** for grouping.

### Step 5 — Add Trend Line

* Go to **Analytics Pane → drag “Trend Line” → drop on chart → choose Linear.**

 **Result:**
A dynamic scatter plot that lets users choose any two measures to compare and automatically see their linear relationship through a trend line.

##  **Visualization 4 — Boxplot (Monthly Distribution & Outliers)**

**Goal:** Show the monthly distribution and detect outliers for a selected measure.

**Steps:**

1. Create a **new worksheet** → rename it **Monthly Boxplot**.
2. Drag **Date → Columns** → change to **Month(Date)**.
3. Drag **Value → Rows**.
4. Drag **Measure → Filters** → choose one measure → click OK.
5. Go to **Analytics Pane → drag Box Plot → drop on chart**.

Each box now represents:

* **Median** (middle line)
* **Quartiles** (box edges)
* **Outliers** (individual points)

 **Optional (Interactivity):**
Create a parameter named **Select Measure**, add all measure names, and use it to dynamically switch the displayed metric.

 **Result:**
A boxplot showing monthly value spread, median, and outliers for the selected measure.

##  **Final Dashboard**

1. Go to **Dashboard → New Dashboard**.
2. Drag and drop all four worksheets.
3. Add relevant **titles and filters** (e.g., Measure filters, X/Y measure selectors).
4. Adjust layout for clean, minimal, and responsive visuals.

 **End Result:**
An interactive dashboard that allows users to explore:

* Time trends
* Distributions
* Correlations
* Outliers

All dynamically controlled through filters and parameters.
